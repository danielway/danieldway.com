I'm a full-stack software developer and student pursuing a B.S. in Software Engineering with minors in Data Science and Cyber Security from Iowa State University.

Professionally, I work with .NET Core and Angular designing and implementing internal and customer-facing web applications. In my own time I explore a variety of technologies and interests.

I am reachable at [projects@danieldway.com](mailto:projects@danieldway.com) and [here](/public.key) is my key.
